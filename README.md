Question 3
You can assign variables from lists like this:
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
first = lst[0]
middle = lst[1:-1]
last = lst[-1]
print(first) ➞ outputs 1
print(middle) ➞ outputs [2, 3, 4, 5]
print(last) ➞ outputs 6
With Python 3, you can assign variables from lists in a much more succinct way. Create
variables first, middle and last from the given list using destructuring assignment
(check the Resources tab for some examples), where:
first ➞ 1
middle ➞ [2, 3, 4, 5]
last ➞ 6

Your task is to unpack the list writeyourcodehere into three variables, being first,
middle, and last, with middle being everything in between the first and last element. Then
print all three variables.

simon_says([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [5, 5, 1, 2, 3]) ➞ False
Notes
 Both input lists will be of the same length, and will have a minimum length of 2.
 The values of the 0-indexed element in the second list and the n-1th indexed element
in the first list do not matter.

Question3
A group of friends have decided to start a secret society. The name will be the first letter of
each of their names, sorted in alphabetical order.
Create a function that takes in a list of names and returns the name of the secret society.

Examples
society_name([&quot;Adam&quot;, &quot;Sarah&quot;, &quot;Malcolm&quot;]) ➞ &quot;AMS&quot;
society_name([&quot;Harry&quot;, &quot;Newt&quot;, &quot;Luna&quot;, &quot;Cho&quot;]) ➞ &quot;CHLN&quot;
society_name([&quot;Phoebe&quot;, &quot;Chandler&quot;, &quot;Rachel&quot;, &quot;Ross&quot;, &quot;Monica&quot;, &quot;Joey&quot;])

Question4
An isogram is a word that has no duplicate letters. Create a function that takes a string and
returns either True or False depending on whether or not it&#39;s an &quot;isogram&quot;.
Examples
is_isogram(&quot;Algorism&quot;) ➞ True
is_isogram(&quot;PasSword&quot;) ➞ False
Not case sensitive.
is_isogram(&quot;Consecutive&quot;) ➞ False
Notes
 Ignore letter case (should not be case sensitive).
 All test cases contain valid one word strings.

Question5
Create a function that takes a string and returns True or False, depending on whether the
characters are in order or not.
Examples
is_in_order(&quot;abc&quot;) ➞ True
is_in_order(&quot;edabit&quot;) ➞ False
is_in_order(&quot;123&quot;) ➞ True
is_in_order(&quot;xyzz&quot;) ➞ True
Notes
You don&#39;t have to handle empty strings.

Programming_Assingment23

Question 1
Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns True or False depending
on whether the number is symmetrical or not. A number is symmetrical when it is the same as
its reverse.
Examples
is_symmetrical(7227) ➞ True
is_symmetrical(12567) ➞ False
is_symmetrical(44444444) ➞ True
is_symmetrical(9939) ➞ False
is_symmetrical(1112111) ➞ True

Question 2
Given a string of numbers separated by a comma and space, return the product of the
numbers.
Examples
multiply_nums(&quot;2, 3&quot;) ➞ 6
multiply_nums(&quot;1, 2, 3, 4&quot;) ➞ 24
multiply_nums(&quot;54, 75, 453, 0&quot;) ➞ 0
multiply_nums(&quot;10, -2&quot;) ➞ -20

Question 3
Create a function that squares every digit of a number.
Examples
square_digits(9119) ➞ 811181
square_digits(2483) ➞ 416649
square_digits(3212) ➞ 9414
Notes
The function receives an integer and must return an integer.

Question 4
Create a function that sorts a list and removes all duplicate items from it.
Examples
setify([1, 3, 3, 5, 5]) ➞ [1, 3, 5]
setify([4, 4, 4, 4]) ➞ [4]
setify([5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15]) ➞ [5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15]
setify([3, 3, 3, 2, 1]) ➞ [1, 2, 3]

Question 5
Create a function that returns the mean of all digits.
Examples
mean(42) ➞ 3
mean(12345) ➞ 3
mean(666) ➞ 6
Notes
 The mean of all digits is the sum of digits / how many digits there are (e.g. mean of digits in
512 is (5+1+2)/3(number of digits) = 8/3=2).
 The mean will always be an integer.

Question1
Create a function that takes an integer and returns a list from 1 to the given number, where:
1. If the number can be divided evenly by 4, amplify it by 10 (i.e. return 10 times the
number).
2. If the number cannot be divided evenly by 4, simply return the number.
Examples
amplify(4) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 40]
amplify(3) ➞ [1, 2, 3]
amplify(25) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 40, 5, 6, 7, 80, 9, 10, 11, 120, 13, 14, 15, 160,
17, 18, 19, 200, 21, 22, 23, 240, 25]
Notes
 The given integer will always be equal to or greater than 1.
 Include the number (see example above).
 To perform this problem with its intended purpose, try doing it with list
comprehensions. If that&#39;s too difficult, just solve the challenge any way you can.

Question2
Create a function that takes a list of numbers and return the number that&#39;s unique.
Examples
unique([3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3]) ➞ 7
unique([0, 0, 0.77, 0, 0]) ➞ 0.77
unique([0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) ➞ 0
Notes
Test cases will always have exactly one unique number while all others are the same.

Question3
Your task is to create a Circle constructor that creates a circle with a radius provided by an
argument. The circles constructed must have two getters getArea() (PIr^2) and
getPerimeter() (2PI*r) which give both respective areas and perimeter (circumference).

For help with this class, I have provided you with a Rectangle constructor which you can use
as a base example.
Examples
circy = Circle(11)
circy.getArea()
 Should return 380.132711084365
circy = Circle(4.44)
circy.getPerimeter()
 Should return 27.897342763877365
Notes
Round results up to the nearest integer.

Question4
Create a function that takes a list of strings and return a list, sorted from shortest to longest.
Examples
sort_by_length([&quot;Google&quot;, &quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Microsoft&quot;])
➞ [&quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Google&quot;, &quot;Microsoft&quot;]
sort_by_length([&quot;Leonardo&quot;, &quot;Michelangelo&quot;, &quot;Raphael&quot;, &quot;Donatello&quot;])
➞ [&quot;Raphael&quot;, &quot;Leonardo&quot;, &quot;Donatello&quot;, &quot;Michelangelo&quot;]
sort_by_length([&quot;Turing&quot;, &quot;Einstein&quot;, &quot;Jung&quot;])
➞ [&quot;Jung&quot;, &quot;Turing&quot;, &quot;Einstein&quot;]
Notes
All test cases contain lists with strings of different lengths, so you won&#39;t have to deal with
multiple strings of the same length.

Question5
Create a function that validates whether three given integers form a Pythagorean triplet. The
sum of the squares of the two smallest integers must equal the square of the largest number to
be validated.

Examples
is_triplet(3, 4, 5) ➞ True
 3² + 4² = 25
 5² = 25
is_triplet(13, 5, 12) ➞ True
 5² + 12² = 169
 13² = 169
is_triplet(1, 2, 3) ➞ False
 1² + 2² = 5
 3² = 9
Notes
Numbers may not be given in a sorted order.

Programming_Assingment25

Question1
Create a function that takes three integer arguments (a, b, c) and returns the amount of
integers which are of equal value.
Examples
equal(3, 4, 3) ➞ 2
equal(1, 1, 1) ➞ 3
equal(3, 4, 1) ➞ 0
Notes
Your function must return 0, 2 or 3.

Question2
Write a function that converts a dictionary into a list of keys-values tuples.
Examples
dict_to_list({
&quot;D&quot;: 1,
&quot;B&quot;: 2,
&quot;C&quot;: 3
}) ➞ [(&quot;B&quot;, 2), (&quot;C&quot;, 3), (&quot;D&quot;, 1)]
dict_to_list({
&quot;likes&quot;: 2,
&quot;dislikes&quot;: 3,
&quot;followers&quot;: 10
}) ➞ [(&quot;dislikes&quot;, 3), (&quot;followers&quot;, 10), (&quot;likes&quot;, 2)]
Notes
Return the elements in the list in alphabetical order.

Question3
Write a function that creates a dictionary with each (key, value) pair being the (lower case,
upper case) versions of a letter, respectively.
Examples
mapping([&quot;p&quot;, &quot;s&quot;]) ➞ { &quot;p&quot;: &quot;P&quot;, &quot;s&quot;: &quot;S&quot; }

mapping([&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]) ➞ { &quot;a&quot;: &quot;A&quot;, &quot;b&quot;: &quot;B&quot;, &quot;c&quot;: &quot;C&quot; }
mapping([&quot;a&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;]) ➞ { &quot;a&quot;: &quot;A&quot;, &quot;v&quot;: &quot;V&quot;, &quot;y&quot;: &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;: &quot;Z&quot; }
Notes
All of the letters in the input list will always be lowercase.

Question4
Write a function, that replaces all vowels in a string with a specified vowel.
Examples
vow_replace(&quot;apples and bananas&quot;, &quot;u&quot;) ➞ &quot;upplus und bununus&quot;
vow_replace(&quot;cheese casserole&quot;, &quot;o&quot;) ➞ &quot;chooso cossorolo&quot;
vow_replace(&quot;stuffed jalapeno poppers&quot;, &quot;e&quot;) ➞ &quot;steffed jelepene peppers&quot;
Notes
All words will be lowercase. Y is not considered a vowel.

Question5
Create a function that takes a string as input and capitalizes a letter if its ASCII code is even
and returns its lower case version if its ASCII code is odd.
Examples
ascii_capitalize(&quot;to be or not to be!&quot;) ➞ &quot;To Be oR NoT To Be!&quot;
ascii_capitalize(&quot;THE LITTLE MERMAID&quot;) ➞ &quot;THe LiTTLe meRmaiD&quot;
ascii_capitalize(&quot;Oh what a beautiful morning.&quot;) ➞ &quot;oH wHaT a BeauTiFuL
moRNiNg.&quot;
