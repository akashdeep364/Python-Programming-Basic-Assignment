is_symmetrical(7227) ➞ True

is_symmetrical(12567) ➞ False

is_symmetrical(44444444) ➞ True

is_symmetrical(9939) ➞ False

is_symmetrical(1112111) ➞ True

2. Given a string of numbers separated by a comma and space, return the product of the numbers.
Examples
multiply_nums("2, 3") ➞ 6

multiply_nums("1, 2, 3, 4") ➞ 24

multiply_nums("54, 75, 453, 0") ➞ 0

multiply_nums("10, -2") ➞ -20

3. Create a function that squares every digit of a number.
Examples
square_digits(9119) ➞ 811181

square_digits(2483) ➞ 416649

square_digits(3212) ➞ 9414
Notes
The function receives an integer and must return an integer.

4. Create a function that sorts a list and removes all duplicate items from it.
Examples
setify([1, 3, 3, 5, 5]) ➞ [1, 3, 5]

setify([4, 4, 4, 4]) ➞ [4]

setify([5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15]) ➞ [5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15]

setify([3, 3, 3, 2, 1]) ➞ [1, 2, 3]

5. Create a function that returns the mean of all digits.
Examples
mean(42) ➞ 3

mean(12345) ➞ 3

mean(666) ➞ 6
Notes
•	The mean of all digits is the sum of digits / how many digits there are (e.g. mean of digits in 512 is (5+1+2)/3(number of digits) = 8/3=2).
•	The mean will always be an integer.


## Programming_Assingment24
1. Create a function that takes an integer and returns a list from 1 to the given number, where:
1.	If the number can be divided evenly by 4, amplify it by 10 (i.e. return 10 times the number).
2.	If the number cannot be divided evenly by 4, simply return the number.
Examples
amplify(4) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 40]

amplify(3) ➞ [1, 2, 3]

amplify(25) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 40, 5, 6, 7, 80, 9, 10, 11, 120, 13, 14, 15, 160, 17, 18, 19, 200, 21, 22, 23, 240, 25]
Notes
•	The given integer will always be equal to or greater than 1.
•	Include the number (see example above).
•	To perform this problem with its intended purpose, try doing it with list comprehensions. If that's too difficult, just solve the challenge any way you can.

2. Create a function that takes a list of numbers and return the number that's unique.
Examples
unique([3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3]) ➞ 7

unique([0, 0, 0.77, 0, 0]) ➞ 0.77

unique([0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) ➞ 0
Notes
Test cases will always have exactly one unique number while all others are the same.

3. Your task is to create a Circle constructor that creates a circle with a radius provided by an argument. The circles constructed must have two getters getArea() (PIr^2) and getPerimeter() (2PI*r) which give both respective areas and perimeter (circumference).
For help with this class, I have provided you with a Rectangle constructor which you can use as a base example.
Examples
circy = Circle(11)
circy.getArea()

# Should return 380.132711084365

circy = Circle(4.44)
circy.getPerimeter()

# Should return 27.897342763877365
Notes
Round results up to the nearest integer.

4. Create a function that takes a list of strings and return a list, sorted from shortest to longest.
Examples
sort_by_length(["Google", "Apple", "Microsoft"])
➞ ["Apple", "Google", "Microsoft"]

sort_by_length(["Leonardo", "Michelangelo", "Raphael", "Donatello"])
➞ ["Raphael", "Leonardo", "Donatello", "Michelangelo"]

sort_by_length(["Turing", "Einstein", "Jung"])
➞ ["Jung", "Turing", "Einstein"]
Notes
All test cases contain lists with strings of different lengths, so you won't have to deal with multiple strings of the same length.

5. Create a function that validates whether three given integers form a Pythagorean triplet. The sum of the squares of the two smallest integers must equal the square of the largest number to be validated.


Examples
is_triplet(3, 4, 5) ➞ True
# 3² + 4² = 25
# 5² = 25

is_triplet(13, 5, 12) ➞ True
# 5² + 12² = 169
# 13² = 169

is_triplet(1, 2, 3) ➞ False
# 1² + 2² = 5
# 3² = 9
Notes
Numbers may not be given in a sorted order.



## Programming_Assingment25

1. Create a function that takes three integer arguments (a, b, c) and returns the amount of integers which are of equal value.
Examples
equal(3, 4, 3) ➞ 2

equal(1, 1, 1) ➞ 3

equal(3, 4, 1) ➞ 0 
Notes
Your function must return 0, 2 or 3.


2. Write a function that converts a dictionary into a list of keys-values tuples.
Examples
dict_to_list({
  "D": 1,
  "B": 2,
  "C": 3
}) ➞ [("B", 2), ("C", 3), ("D", 1)]

dict_to_list({
  "likes": 2,
  "dislikes": 3,
  "followers": 10
}) ➞ [("dislikes", 3), ("followers", 10), ("likes", 2)]
Notes
Return the elements in the list in alphabetical order.


3. Write a function that creates a dictionary with each (key, value) pair being the (lower case, upper case) versions of a letter, respectively.
Examples
mapping(["p", "s"]) ➞ { "p": "P", "s": "S" }

mapping(["a", "b", "c"]) ➞ { "a": "A", "b": "B", "c": "C" }

mapping(["a", "v", "y", "z"]) ➞ { "a": "A", "v": "V", "y": "Y", "z": "Z" }
Notes
All of the letters in the input list will always be lowercase.

4. Write a function, that replaces all vowels in a string with a specified vowel.
Examples
vow_replace("apples and bananas", "u") ➞ "upplus und bununus"

vow_replace("cheese casserole", "o") ➞ "chooso cossorolo"

vow_replace("stuffed jalapeno poppers", "e") ➞ "steffed jelepene peppers"
Notes
All words will be lowercase. Y is not considered a vowel.

5. Create a function that takes a string as input and capitalizes a letter if its ASCII code is even and returns its lower case version if its ASCII code is odd.
Examples
ascii_capitalize("to be or not to be!") ➞ "To Be oR NoT To Be!"

ascii_capitalize("THE LITTLE MERMAID") ➞ "THe LiTTLe meRmaiD"

ascii_capitalize("Oh what a beautiful morning.") ➞ "oH wHaT a BeauTiFuL moRNiNg."
